## Project description
This project is a case management system. 

We're partnering with the [DC Abortion Fund](http://dcabortionfund.org/), an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that makes grants to women and girls in DC, Maryland, and Virginia who cannot afford the full cost of an abortion.

## Working With Jekyll 

This repo has a `gh-pages` branch, currently used for displaying live pages. To contribute to those pages (this assumes you have ruby installed): 

* clone it -- `$ git clone git@github.com:colinxfleming/dcaf_case_management.git`
* Install the jekyll gem -- `$ gem install jekyll`
* Start the web server -- `$ jekyll serve --baseurl ''`
* Navigate to `http://localhost:4000`
* Make changes to the pages in the root directory or the assets in `_sass` and hack awawy!
