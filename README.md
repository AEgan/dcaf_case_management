## Project description
This project is a case management system. 

We're partnering with the [DC Abortion Fund](http://dcabortionfund.org/), an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that makes grants to women and girls in DC, Maryland, and Virginia who cannot afford the full cost of an abortion.
